## üìö Repository Structure

The repository is designed for efficient interview preparation:

- **Algorithms**: Common algorithms organized by category
- **Data Structures**: Implementations with usage examples
- **Problems**: Real interview problems organized by difficulty
- **Patterns**: Common algorithm patterns with explanations
- **Cheatsheets**: Quick reference guides for interviews
- **Utils**: Helper tools for testing and visualization

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14+ for JavaScript implementations
- Python 3.8+ for Python implementations
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dsa-practice.git
cd dsa-practice

# Install JavaScript dependencies
npm install

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üí° How to Use

### Learning Algorithm Patterns

Start with the `patterns/` directory to understand common algorithm patterns. Each pattern includes:
- Explanation of the technique
- When to use it
- Example problems where it applies

### Practicing Problems

Problems are organized by difficulty:
- `problems/easy/` - Fundamental problems
- `problems/medium/` - Intermediate challenges
- `problems/hard/` - Advanced problems

Each problem includes:
- Problem statement
- Solution in JavaScript and Python
- Test cases

### Running Tests

```bash
# JavaScript
npm test -- problems/easy/two_sum

# Python
python utils/py/test_runner.py problems/easy/two_sum
```

## üìÜ Study Plan

For effective interview preparation:

1. **Week 1-2**: Learn basic data structures (arrays, strings, linked lists)
2. **Week 3-4**: Study core algorithms (sorting, searching)
3. **Week 5-6**: Practice pattern recognition with medium problems
4. **Week 7-8**: Tackle advanced topics (dynamic programming, graphs)
5. **Week 9+**: Mock interviews and hard problems

## üß† Algorithm Patterns

Understanding these patterns helps solve many problems:

1. **Two Pointers**: For problems involving sorted arrays, palindromes
2. **Sliding Window**: For problems involving subarrays/substrings
3. **Fast & Slow Pointers**: For cycle detection, middle elements
4. **Merge Intervals**: For interval-related problems
5. **Depth-First Search**: For tree/graph traversal
6. **Breadth-First Search**: For shortest path problems
7. **Dynamic Programming**: For optimization problems
